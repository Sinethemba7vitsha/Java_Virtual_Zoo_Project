Virtual Zoo
Project Overview
Welcome to the Virtual Zoo project! This project is a simulation of a zoo management system that utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstract classes, and interfaces. The goal of the project is to provide a framework for managing different types of animals in a zoo, where each animal has unique behaviors but shares common attributes.

Key Concepts Implemented:
Inheritance: Animal classes inherit common behaviors and properties from a base Animal class.
Polymorphism: Different animals can perform the same action but in different ways (e.g., different ways to eat).
Encapsulation: Animal details such as name and age are hidden and accessed via getters and setters.
Abstract Classes: Abstract Animal class defines a common structure and behavior for subclasses.
Interfaces: Interface like Swimmable and Flyable are implemented by specific animals that can swim or fly.
Features
Add various animals (Lion, Elephant, Penguin, etc.) to the zoo.
Animals have behaviors like eating, sleeping, and making sounds.
Specialized animals (e.g., Dolphins) can swim, and Birds can fly.
Polymorphism allows animals to be treated generically while still maintaining unique behavior.
Technologies
Java (or any OOP language)
